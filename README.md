Leaflet for Java API
====================

This version of [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) library 
for rendering of mobile friendly interactive maps in Java 
has been designed by students of 
[Johannes Kepler University](http://jku.at) of Linz 
(Andreas Grimmer, Christoph Sperl, Stefan Wurzinger) as part of their 
2015 API Design course. 
The API has been adopted and is distributed as part of the DukeScript project.

The main repository has been moved to https://github.com/dukescript/leaflet4j

The javadoc is exposed at https://dukescript.com/javadoc/leaflet4j/
